# Retraced ReactJS Demo

Example project showcasing how to use the retraced SDKs to send events into retraced and render audit events.

### Get Started

Requires node/npm/yarn

Install Deps

```sh
yarn
```

Run frontend server

```sh
yarn start
```

Run backend server with your retraced credentials

```
RETRACED_API_TOKEN=... RETRACED_PROJECTID=... yarn serve-backend
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to view events.

This project uses `react-scripts` to simplify build configuration. You can use `npm eject` to get the webpack etc. configurations.

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find information on how to perform common tasks and the recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
