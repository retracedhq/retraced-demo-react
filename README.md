This project uses `react-scripts` to simplify build configuration. You can use `npm eject` to get the webpack etc. configurations.

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find information on how to perform common tasks and the recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
